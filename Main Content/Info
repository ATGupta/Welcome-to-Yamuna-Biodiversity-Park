Spread over 457 acres upstream of the River Yamuna, the Yamuna Biodiversity Park (YBP) is a Nature Reserve, which has successfully recreated Delhi Yamuna’s native ecosystems. Through the conservation efforts of DDA (Delhi Development Authority) and the work of experts in the field of ecology, plant, insect, mammal, reptile, and bird, this once barren area now has 1,500 plant, insect, bird, fish and mammal species living in different aquatic (water-based), terrestrial (land-based) and arboreal (tree-based) habitats.
YBP Phase I spreads over an area of 157 acre on inactive floodplains of river Yamuna while Phase II spreads over an area of 300 acre on the active floodplain of the river near Wazirabad. The major components of Yamuna Biodiversity Park Phase I are Conservatories of Medicinal plants, Butterflies and Fruit yielding species, besides Rangelands, Sacred grove, Migratory ducks’ wetland, resident ducks’ wetland etc. Around 30 Forest communities are developed in YBP which offer suitable habitats for a diversity of animal species to come, survive and breed. The wetland created in the park attracts thousands of migratory ducks from Siberia, Europe and China  in winters besides many resident birds.
YBP Phase II consists of a mosaic of wetlands together with the grasslands and floodplain forests. The wetland of 100 acre has already started attracting a diversity of resident and migratory birds and impounds substantial amount of floodwaters.

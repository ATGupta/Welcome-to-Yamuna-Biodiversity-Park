
Introduction
Not only is the Brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus) the most widespread terrestrial snake in the world, but this tiny, subterranean serpent is only of only two known unisexual snake species, with no males having ever been discovered. Appearing more like a dark, shiny earthworm than a true snake, this primitive species has a small, cylindrical, body covered in smooth black scales that help to limit friction. Other adaptations to its burrowing lifestyle include scale-covered, vestigial eyes, a rigid skull, and a blunt snout.

Nature Education is mandatory and a major responsibility of YBP to ignite young minds towards environmental conservation. Starting from the ecological literacy to common man, the target audience is not only school and college group but also teachers and various trainees coming from various courses. The Biodiversity Parks with its rich flora and fauna and expertise are ideal instruments for promoting conservation education that ultimately will have positive impacts on environmental quality and conservation ethics. The parks offers a wide range of opportunities to live, learn and adapt the ways and means by which humans live in harmony with the rest of the nature . The Biodiversity Parks with its rich flora and fauna and expertise are ideal instruments for promoting conservation education that ultimately will have positive impacts on environmental quality and conservation ethics. Visitors of all age groups (from school going children to the adults) may find excellent Nature Interpretation Centre and amphitheatre.
The park is working as an open-air laboratory for a range of students and researchers and groups are taken within the park on predetermined nature trail. 
The park with its developing ecosystems, which are under various stages of development, provides a good opportunity to learn about the following:
�	Identification of prominent species of plants and animals 
�	Identification of over 450 species of medicinal plants
�	Lessons in seed germination
�	Interpretation of nature through interactive educational software (developed in-house) in the Nature Interpretation Center with touch screens, visual-aids and demonstrated articles
�	Concept and demonstration of bioremediation
�	Process of ecosystem redevelopment
�	Role of pioneer and other species 
�	Understanding the intricacies of relationships between different components of ecosystem 
�	Interactions between species and the flow of energy between biotic and abiotic components that comprises the ecosystem processes. 
�	Food webs
�	Life history strategies 
�	Behavioural patterns 
�	Adaptations
Nature education is promoted by inviting educational trips to parks, encouraging plantation drives, workshops and seminars. The parks intend to organize special training programs for youth and especially interested groups of individuals to make them aware of the environment and human relationship, the ideology behind the establishment of this park and provide information on the developmental stages of these parks.

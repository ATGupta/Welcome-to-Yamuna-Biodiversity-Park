Butterflies perform a very crucial process of pollination of plants but the wild population is in a world-wide decline due to loss of habitat and extensive use of insecticides. This conservatory harbors many larval food plants and nectar plants which support more than 75 species of butterflies. Some of the prominent species are Plain tiger, Lime Butterfly, Common Silverline, Small Salmon Arab and pansies.
